**This will probably not be fully support for v12 onwards as the system now has it's own Pronouns for users, if there is enough interest I will consider looking at upgrading it for 12**

# Player Pronouns
Add the functionality to manually set a player's pronouns via the Player Configuration menu (accessed by right clicking on a player's name in the player list).

## Setup

This allows you to manually add your own pronouns on the player configuration.

### Show Pronouns in Player List
This will add the entered pronouns after the player name, but before the character name in the Player List

### Show pronouns next to player name in chat
This will add the entered pronouns after the player name in the chatbox

### Enable Character Pronouns
This allows you to manually add your own pronouns on the player configuration for a selected character.

### Show Pronouns in Player List

### Show Character Pronouns after character name in chat

### Save Pronouns to Gender Field
This will save the selected character pronoun to the Gender of the actor. This has been confirmed to work on most systems. If it doesn't save to the gender field on your system, please load an issue.
